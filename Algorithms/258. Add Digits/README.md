# [258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/)

Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

**Example 1:**

    Input: num = 38
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The process is
    38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
    11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
    Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

**Example 2:**

    Input: num = 0
    Output: 0

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you do it without any loop/recursion in `O(1)` runtime?

**Hint 1:**

A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods?

**Hint 2:**

What are all the possible results?

**Hint 3:**

How do they occur, periodically or randomly?

**Hint 4:**
